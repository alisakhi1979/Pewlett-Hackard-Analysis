# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Purpose:** 
The purpose of Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis is to provide a workforce planning metric in prepration for 'silver tsunami' as many employees are due for retirment. This analysis aims to identify the requirements for mentorship program for retirees replacements.

**Objectives:** 
The overarching objectives and related deliverables for this analysis are the followings:

1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. AThe Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

**Resources:**
1. Data Source: 
- Pewlett-Hackard employee database

2. Software: 
- PostgreSQL
- SQL

**Hewlett-Hackard outputs:**
    
1. Count of Retirees by role
2. Count of eligibile employees for mentorship program

**Results:**

1. There are 7 roles impavted by the retirement of the employees out of which Senior Engineer and Senior Staff make up the 63% of the entire retiree poulation.
2. There are 12,242 staff and 1761 Assistant Engineer due for retirement 
3. A total of 1549 employees are eligible for mentorship program
4. Out of all eligible employees there are only 402 Senior Engineer and 299 Senior Staff

**Summary:**
Findings of this analysis suggests that the impact of employee retirment is large in volume and the number of eligible employees for mentorship program is relatively small. Therefor, Pewlett-Hackard should look into diffren strategies to manage Silver Tsunami. One approach could be creating programs by phases based on the date of retirement (below is the breakdown of retiress by year of birth). Certainly, Pewlett-Hackard should look into acquiring new talents specially for more junior positions like staff and assistant engineer.
